Commander Ford is missed greatly at 20th Century-Fox. But 20th Century-Fox is indeed proud of Commander Ford who is tonight on a ship somewhere in the Far East.

I'd like to say of ""Target for Tonight"" that it represents probably a very high level of the humanist tradition in the documentary film; I mean none of the men concerned were actors.

But even in this wonderful moment my common sense reminds me quite clearly that most of the work that went into earning this award was not done by Olivia de Havilland at all, but by a big team of other people who, if justice were really to prevail, would be standing up here beside me now.  When I think of the writer who created ""Jody Norris,"" and how much of her sprang from the heart and mind of the director. When I remember the businessmen who found and managed the money which produced her and distributed her.  And how she grew under the talents and skills of the technicians: the cameraman, the makeup man, the hairdresser, the costumer. And then I think how much the musicians did for her.

He turns up in all sorts of places under all sorts of names and disguises.  First time I ever met him he told me his name was George Seaton.  And wonderfully, George Seaton has his revenge by bringing him to life.  About a year and a half ago he suddenly turned up in Culver City and told me his name was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  That was the day Metro agreed to loan me to Fox to make the picture.  And now I think it's time Santa Claus added a word to his name.  I think he ought to call himself Santa Claus, Incorporated.  Santa Claus, Inc.  Inc.!  For then he would embrace all you wonderful, kind people who have done me the honor of making me stand here tonight.

(Armat and Spoor not present)",Jean Hersholt (Academy President),"March 20, 1948; Shrine Civic Auditorium","I feel like a grandfather who's watched his little grandchild grow up to be a big and beautiful and lovely lady.  I saw the movies when they were in their swaddling clothes.  We began at the very beginning.  I showed my first Vitagraph picture fifty-two years ago in March of 1896.  Then Vitagraph made its first comedy in 1897, fifty-one years ago.  It was a little picture with a cast of three.  The total cost of production was $3.50 minus the cost of film, which at that time was seven and 7/8 cents per foot.  The next year, in 1898, we produced our first feature picture.  It was a reproduction of the Battle of Santiago Bay, or the destruction of Admiral Cervera's Spanish fleet. The total cost of production was $1.98.  This was inexpensive because we made the picture from cutouts of photographs which we tacked to little bits of wood and put in water with a piece of white cardboard in the rear for the sky.  The press was very good.  The press said that the picture was even better than the battle itself so it must have been good.  And so I feel very proud and very happy to have seen that little child in swaddling clothes grow up to be such a big and beautiful lady.  And I want to thank everyone who has had a part in so doing and I want to thank the Academy for remembering the forgotten man."1947 (20th) Academy Awards,Best Motion Picture,Gentleman's Agreement,20th Century-Fox (accepted by producer Darryl F.

I was proud just to be at a remote table in the back of the room at that time.  I'm proud to be here.  I want to thank Laura Hobson for writing the book.  I want to thank Moss Hart for his screenplay.  And I've already joined with you in thanking our wonderful director.  I also want to thank all of the members of the cast; our editor, Harmon Jones; Artie Miller, that wonderful cameraman.  This is my second time; I'm going to keep on trying.  I was very disappointed once a number of years ago with a picture that I know you'll forgive me for mentioning tonight because this makes up for that disappointment. ""Gentleman's Agreement"" makes up for a lot of them.  But for that picture, forgive me for mentioning it and I only do so because it still remains a picture of which I am proud, ""Wilson.""

I can think of a lot of things I'd love to say and I couldn't say 'em in fifteen seconds. I would like to say this, because I hear a lot of kidding about what people say when they get one of these, but you do feel grateful to a few people that helped you to. And I would like to say to a man by the name of Darryl Zanuck, who's given me a couple pretty wonderful opportunities, to Henry King, a fine man and a great director, I'm very grateful.

I met a lot of warm, generous people and I am very happy that Ingmar Bergman asked me to represent him on this big occasion, though I would have been more happy if he himself could have been here tonight getting personally all the respect and love which has been shown him. He has asked me to say to you that he is sitting on his little island in the Baltic writing on a new script. He isn't here because he feels that a long trip at this moment would do great harm to his concentration on work and he believes that he shows his respect and gratefulness to the honor bestowed to him by the Board and members of the Academy by staying home finishing his script. And he also feels that this fantastic award will inspire him in his fulfillment of his work.

Because last year when ""Day and Night"" won for the best picture I couldn't believe it that Valentina Cortese was not nominated, because she gave the most beautiful performance.  [Finds Cortese in the audience:]  There you are!  She gave the most beautiful performance that all we actresses recognized because, after all, we have all forgotten our lines and always open the wrong doors, and it was wonderful to see her do it so beautifully.

It was Charlie Bluhdorn's idea.

And then I went home and I thought about it, and I realized that because it maybe was such an easy way to fail, which was probably the best reason to try to tackle what seems so impossible. And it's, I'm really happy I did.  I just want to thank Gordie Willis who was the photographer, who did a beautiful job.

Well, it certainly is thrilling for me and it's nice to get the Irving Thalberg Award handed to me from another director, and a good one, too.  I was a very dear, dear friend of Irving Thalberg's and it was a shame that a man like Irving Thalberg had to pass away at thirty-seven years old.  He was a genius.  He had great heart, great feeling, great imagination.  After a preview that you'd go to, Irving would sit up with you upstairs at Metro and he'd say, ""I know what's good about the picture, tell me what's wrong about the picture.""  And Irving never made a criticism about a movie unless he could improve it.  That's the kind of a man he was.  And this means so much to me that I can't tell you.  He was quite a guy.  I loved him. He was very close to me.

But I know that my mother would be delighted.  She had great potential for an actress but didn't think she should do it, so she pushed me and was delighted.  And Michael Chekhov, the great actor and teacher who I studied with, who gave me a love and respect for the theater, which is the whole point of why we're all here.

I'd like to thank Public Television for allowing me to break all the rules and spend a little more money than I should have.  I'd like to thank the man I love for not allowing me to break us up.

I had nothing to lose so I played my hunches.  A standard complaint of producers over the years has been that the studio ruined the picture or got me to change it, or the ads were lousy or the distributor didn't understand the film.  In my case this wasn't so.  The pictures that went out with my name -- good, bad or indifferent -- were produced by me.

But I want to say just a couple of things about how a filmmaker like Woody evolves.  About seven years ago, David Picker brought us into United Artists with the simple words: Woody, do your thing.  And through the years we have gotten nothing but support, encouragement, help and love from Eric Pleskow, Arthur Krim, Gabe Sumner and Danny Rissner.  They've allowed Woody to mature into a fine filmmaker.  This is truly an exciting night for all of us.  I guess we all fantasize about something like this happening and now it's a reality.  I'm very pleased.

And through the National Film Board it's been possible for many Canadian filmmakers, Americans, and people from all over the world to express themselves and put their feelings on film, express themselves culturally, pioneer in all kinds of animation and film techniques.  And I think I should be grateful for them all because it was through them and the National Film Board and all my helpers that I've been able to make this little film.  And I hope you can all see it.

And then on April 4, April 3, he refuses to come out of his apartment.  Thanks also to Gordie Willis for his wonderful photography; for Keaton, for obvious reasonsâ€“Diane, that is.  And to the boys in the back room:  Arthur, and Eric, and Bill, and Bob, and Marcia, and Mike, for their continued support and benign neglect which is the key to our success.

When I was a small, small school boy, I was terribly interested in the cinema.  Became a film fan, wrote to Deanna Durbin.  Got a reply, was delighted.  Wrote to Ginger Rogers, didn't get a reply.  Then of course, I got interested in the cinema as an art form, and I wrote a twelve-page letter to Billy Wilder after seeing ""Double Indemnity.""  He didn't reply either.  Well, there you are.  I have learned everything I've learned about the craft of cinema from the making of American films.  I've been watching American films very carefully over the years and I loved them for what they entertain, and then later loved them for what they taught.  So, I express my gratitude to the American cinema, to the motion picture association who have given me this award and who have made me feel so proud.

And if I could thank you all I would, but I have more pressing debts:  to E. M. Forster, for creating ""Margaret Schlegel;"" to James Ivory, for asking me to play her; to Ismail Merchant, for paying me to play her, which feels very unnecessary at this moment.  Actually, I think I might have to give back the money.  And to Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, for her flawless adaptation.  To a superlative cast and crew.  To Sony Pictures Classics, for their dedication and commitment.  And especially to Sir Anthony Hopkins, for being, like this, the (k)night of my life.

Because for me it was a very special film, as I was welcomed into the family of Ismail Merchant and Jim Ivory.  And I would very much like to pay a great tribute to them, because in Ismail we found a constructive and enthusiastic and encouraging producer, and in Jim a charismatic and meticulous director who believes in the visual importance of the film and who brooks no compromise.

I stand guilty before the world of directing over three hundred cartoons in the last fifty or sixty years.  Hopefully this means you've forgiven me. When, in 1931, I came stumbling out of Chouinard Art Institute into the arid maelstrom of the Great Depression in the wan hope that I could resume my school career as a janitor, a miracle occurred so staggeringly unexpected and unbelievable that I find it incredible even today.  Somebody offered to pay me to draw.  And so this miracle continues.  For nearly seventy years I've been paid adequately, if not lavishly, for doing what I enjoy doing most.  A miracle indeed.  Robert Frost expresses it best: ""My object in life,"" he said, ""is to unite my avocation and my vocation, as my two eyes are one in sight.""

And one thing I have learned about film writing is how communal it is.  And the reason people give thanks is because there's so many people that had so much to do with this film and with the music.  From Peter Gelb from Sony Classics who introduced me to FranÃ§ois Girard, the wonderful director of this film, and Niv Fichman the producer.  But then you have to go to the voice of the violin and say, you know, you can write all the notes you want, but if someone doesn't play them like a god they'll never sound that way.

The first person that came to mind when I tried to pick them out was a little guy who worked on the film I did called ""The Party.""

And then there was a confused Italian actor that we tried to get him to understand what this okay sign [makes ""okay"" hand sign] meant in our vernacular.  Okay. We just said, just do that [makes ""okay"" hand sign].  And he always did this [makes wrong hand sign].  And so we decided better we conform to him than he to us.  So from then on, on the set, I would say, get the shot, Phil?  [Makes wrong hand sign]. Cutting room:  you drop a couple frames just before the alligator swallows the chimp, Ralphie?

I was nine and I asked my dad, ""Can I have your movie camera?  That old, wind-up 8mm camera that was in your drawer?"" And he goes, ""Sure, take it.""  And I took it and I started making movies with it and I started being as creative as I could, and never once in my life did my parents ever say, ""What you're doing is a waste of time.""  Never.  And I grew up, I had teachers, I had colleagues, I had people that I worked with all through my life who always told me what you're doing is not a waste of time. So that was normal to me that it was okay to do that.  I know there are kids out there that don't have that support system, so if you're out there and you're listening, listen to me:  If you want to be creative, get out there and do it; it's not a waste of time.

The story ""Alice in Wonderland"" was described by its publisher in 1865 as a story valued for its rare imagination, priceless humor, and power to transport the reader into a world of pure fantasy; a gift to us all.  The heart of any movie lies with the director and I've been incredibly lucky on this and many films to work with the singular Tim Burton.  Tim's imagination along with the amazing cast â€“ Johnny's incandescent ""Hatter,"" Mia's ""Alice"" for all girls all times, Helena's the fearless, big-headed queen, and our crystalline snowflake princess Anne Hathaway â€“ made my job a delight.

Friends, family, ladies and gentlemen, members of the Academy:  Thank you.  Let me tell you a little about myself.  As an actor I've played more bandits, thieves, killers, warlords, molesters, and mafiosi than you could shake a stick at.  As a civilian I collect antique clocks, tell endless stories of my days as a medic in World War II, watch every tennis match, live for my family [and] daily mail, run the dishwasher, take pictures of faces in the bark of trees.  I really have a penchant for a man named Josh Brolin.  [Pointing:] There he is."2010 (83rd) Academy Awards,Irving G.

But there were so many... I'm about three or four or five years older than the wonderful generation that did so much, so I'm very proud of them.  And the fact that this is the Thalberg Award is, the significance is not lost on me.  Because this is an award for producing.  This is not about my own writing and my own filmmaking, but this is about the talent that I came to really value.  And it's more about ""American Graffiti"" and ""The Black Stallion"" and ""Koyaanisqatsi,"" and I could go on, about ""Napoleon"" performed in the Radio City Music Hall with a live orchestra.  That happened because I'd always heard from my father that in the days when he was a boy, when he went to the movies to see ""Don Juan"" or ""The Thief of Bagdad,"" that there was a symphony orchestra.  And I said, gee, I'd love to see that.  And the way to see it was to take the ""Napoleon"" restoration and get a full-out symphony orchestra and perform it.  And it was a wonderful hit.  It was riveting.  And I'm so proud of the fact that that tradition of once again combining live music with the great silent films, or with any film, has become really something that we can see."2011 (84th) Academy Awards,Actor in a Leading Role,The Artist,Jean Dujardin,Natalie Portman,"February 26, 2012; Hollywood & Highland Center","Thank you.
